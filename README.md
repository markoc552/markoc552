  Hello 👋, my name is Marko.
 
 👀 If you don't mind taking a minute or two I would like to introduce myself 😅. Ever since childhood computers 💻 have been my passion. 
 That passion was passed to me by my dad 👱🏻‍♂️ at the start. At that time most of my interests in computers were hardware. 
 When I met in more detail with programming languages in college, I realized that I had found a new passion and call for a job that I would like to pursue. 
 
 💻 Today my biggest interest is Web3 Applications powered with blockchain technology. 
 I love to design robust and optimized backend services with the focus on perfomances and scalability.
 
:octocat: In my Github repos you can find web3 decentralized apps as well as centralized apps created with Java and Spring ecosystem as well as frontends designed and created with React library.
