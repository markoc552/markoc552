  Hello 👋, my name is Marko.
 
 👀 If you don't mind taking a minute or two I would like to introduce myself 😅. Ever since childhood computers 💻 have been my passion. 
 That passion was passed to me by my dad 👱🏻‍♂️ at the start. At that time most of my interests in computers were hardware. 
 When I met in more detail with programming languages in college, I realized that I had found a new passion and call for a job that I would like to pursue. 
 
 💻 Today my biggest interest is Web3 Applications powered with blockchain technology. 
 I love to design robust and optimized backend services with the focus on perfomances and scalability.
 
 On my Github repos you can find decentralized as well as centralized apps created with Java and Spring ecosystem as well as frontends designed and created with React library.
